# ym
script to easily download mp3 musics using youtube-dl and ffmpeg in android's termux

# How to use
run `termux-fix-shebang ym.sh`

# TODO:
> make it possible to download entire playlists without overcomplicating interface (it's meant to be used in a smartphone, the simplest the better)

> make a installation script to make a soft link or to copy the script into the equivalent to /usr/local/bin directory
